Using nature-inspired-algorithms to solve Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

Travelling Salesman Problem is a very famous discrete optimization problem; you can read more about it on http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/ or on wikipedia!

I've solved TSP using Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing using Python uptil now! I'll be posting the code soon.
You can manually supply the city's co-ordinates; but ideally there are TSP datasets available. http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/data/index.html
My code incorporates that^ feature as well!
